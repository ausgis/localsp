## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* The `\dontrun` tag is used in the `lisp` function documentation because the single-core computation is time-consuming. Additionally, it is employed to eliminate all RCMD check messages generated by `devtools::check()` under the current setup, which is why `\donttest` was not used.
